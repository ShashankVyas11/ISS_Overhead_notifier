# ISS_Overhead_notifier
The ISS Overhead Notifier is a Python project that allows you to receive notifications when the International Space Station (ISS) is passing overhead at your location. 
This project utilizes the [Open Notify API](http://open-notify.org/) to fetch the ISS's current position and determines if it will be visible from your coordinates.
## Features
- Get notifications when the ISS is passing overhead.
- Configure notification methods (e.g., email, SMS).
- Customizable alert threshold for the elevation angle.
- Supports multiple platforms and notification services.
